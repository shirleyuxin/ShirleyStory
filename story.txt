One day, a man named Mike walked down a street and found a big balloon. He grabbed the balloon and flew up with it.

He flew 10,000 feet up air the air, and it felt super thrilling. However, the thrill was all gone when the balloon popped. 

As the man was falling he couldn't help but notice the most beautiful of birds. Believe it or not, the bird flew closer and closer until finally the man landed on top of the bird as they flew away.
